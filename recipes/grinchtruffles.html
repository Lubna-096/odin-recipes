        <p>Grinch Truffles are the easiest way to prepare a perfectly portioned 
            sweet treat using only Oreo cookies and cream cheese. Creamy, smooth, 
            and coated in Grinch-green candy, they're the best bite of Oreo balls 
            that you don't have to bake.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>36 Regular Oreos</li>
            <li>½ cup whipped cream cheese spread</li>
            <li>12 ounces (½ 24-ounce) package vanilla almond bark</li>
            <li>Green gel food coloring</li>
            <li>18 red heart sprinkles</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the oreos in a food processor or blender and crush completely into crumbs, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the crumbs into a large mixing bowl and stir in the cream cheese spread until a thick mixture forms. You may want to use your clean hands to make this easier.</li>
            <li>Scoop the mixture into balls using a 1 ½ Tablespoons cookie scoop and roll them smooth.</li>
            <li>Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the balls in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour or until firm.</li>
            <li>Once you are ready to decorate your Grinch Truffles, place the vanilla almond bark in a medium sized, microwave bowl.</li>
            <li>Microwave for 1 minute and then stir well.</li>
            <li>Continue to microwave in 15-30 second increments until the almond bark is completely melted. This should take about 2 minutes total. Be sure to stir in between each heating so that the bark doesn’t seize up.</li>
            <li>Add in your desired amount of green gel food coloring and stir until you have your desired color. Do not use liquid food coloring or the almond bark will seize.</li>
            <li>Dip the truffle balls, one by one, in the melted almond bark until fully covered.</li>
            <li>Allow the excess coating to drip off and then replace them on the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place a heart sprinkle onto each of the truffles while the coating is still soft and then return the truffles to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes to an hour, or until the coating is fully hardened.</li>
            <li>Serve cold or at room temperature./li>
        </ol>
