        <p>This is the easiest 3-ingredient 7UP Cherry Cobbler 
            you will ever make! Serve with a scoop of ice cream 
            for a delicious dessert.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>63 ounces (3 21-ounce) cans of cherry pie filling</li>
            <li>15.25 ounces box of yellow cake mix</li>
            <li>2¼ cups (20 ounces) 7UP lemon-lime soda </li>
            <li>1½-2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>Vanilla ice cream</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously spray a 9×13 
                baking dish with baker’s spray (Baker’s Joy or generic version).</li>
            <li>Evenly spread 2 cans of cherry pie filling in the bottom 
                of the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Evenly sprinkle the dry yellow cake mix over the cherry pie filling.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the 7UP over the cake mix layer. 
                (It will be foamy) Use a spoon to gently smooth the very top layer 
                of the cake mix and 7UP. You only want to smooth, not stir, the top layer.</li>
            <li>Spoon 5-6 dollops of the remaining cherry pie filling. (Before baking, 
                the cobbler will appear very wet. That is why the baking time is a bit long, 
                but it is needed) Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes (Every oven bakes 
                differently, just be sure to keep a close eye on your cobbler, 
                maybe checking around 55 minutes. In my oven, 1 hour 5 minutes was 
                the perfect bake time) until the cake is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and use a pastry brush to brush the melted butter 
                over the exposed cake, if desired. Allow the cake to cool completely before 
                serving with vanilla ice cream. (The longer the cobbler sits and cools will 
                firm up the cobbler. It will take a while to cool completely.)</li>
        </ol>
